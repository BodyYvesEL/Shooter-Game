# Flying Madman Shooter Game

Creating the Flying Madman Shooter Game using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was a great way to learn Web Development while also creating an exciting and engaging game. This project has allowed me to develop my skills in HTML and CSS for layout styling, and JavaScript for game logic and interactivitity. Additionally, by creating this game, I have learned about game development process, user experience, and game design. After completing the process and programming, I have acquired a medium foundation in Web Development and I am able to continue building more complex and interactive applications. 
## Motivation

The motivation of creating this shooter game was to provide players with an exciting and immersive short gaming experience. I wanted to create game that was fast-paced, action-packed, and challenging.
### Objectives

The objectives of the game is to survive enemy attacks and ultimately defeat withstand the time frame and reaching 500 points to win. Players will have to strategize and fire shots faster to eleminate enemies and have the ability to progress through. 
## Game Description

The shooter takes the place in an imaginary world overrun by mutant bugs, bats, beetles and monsters. The player takes on the role of an explorer who must fight his way through flying bats and bees. He also has to battle his way through ground mutations like Laser Spiders, etc. At the end, he will become a "true" explorer if he wins the game. If not, he is a loser and can keep being "mad."
### Player

The player is equipped with an aircraft powered with a machine gun with many rounds of fire. He can reload anytime as long as he stays calm while avoiding collision with enemies.
### Enemy1

The first type of enemy is a fast-flying mutant (Bad Bat) with a melee attack. They are weak but can overwhelm the player if not killed quickly. They become had to kill the longer the game goes.
### Enemy2

The second type of enemy is a range of Bubble Head mutation. They are as dangerous as the first enemy and has a similar strength. They are not that difficultto be killed but contribute to the ground challenge that the player will encounter.
### Enemy3

The third type of enemy is a Stalker Bee with similar strength as both enemy1 and enemy2. They accompany enemy1 flying above the surface. Player can fastly accumulate points to win the game by targeting them fast. But they also become faster into the game and can cause damage leading to live lost for player.
### Enemy4

The forth type of enemy is monster simply known as Monster. This mutation with an unknown origin compensates to the other three enemies. There are no special abilities this enemy performs apart from colliding with player leading to live lost.
### Enemy5

This fifth type of enemy is a mutation spider. This enemy has the ability to use laser projections to attack the player when they collide. Due to this special ability, this enemy is known as the Laser Spider. Just like the Bad Beetle, Monster, and Bubble Head, the Laser Spider also contribute to the ground challenge for the player.
### Enemy6

The sixth type of enemy is the Bad Beetle. They are difficult to kill at all stage. They have an advange with their exoskeleton which is hard and resist fire shots. Bad Beetle benefits the player as they generate more lives when killed. Thy can be considered as the boss with that unique ability in the game.
## Design Process

The design process for this game was simple if compared to the other tasks such as programing the complete game to function. At this stage, the knowledged gained applied to the basic which was sufficient to bring the game to live and fulfill the logic as planned. For that, this game was design and built on a set of structured steps while holding a broad vision of how the final product should look like. The following subsections distinctively provide the various steps that contributed to the final product.
### Thinking about a game

According to my knowledge, the starting point of project should begin with knowing what is being demanded and what are the required "tools" to build, iterate, and build and deploy or submit the final product. Given these steps, it was easy to think about what is feasible to be built, if there are mistakes, challenges or bugs and how fast could that be resolved. Since the task was to build a simple game, it was certain and preferable to work on a game which is easy based on the level of programming knowledge acquired till now. And according to the lecturer, "You should think about a childhood game or what you can build that reflects your knowledge so far into the course." And so I did. The idea to build a shooter game was burn.
### Initial Sketching

The next step of the process was to think about how the game should look. I started the process by sketching the environment. I started with the background to get a feel of the both the landscape and characters (player and enemies). Since I wanted to create a shooter game but in a different environment (imaginary), I went for a landscape with hanging Island, cloudy view to a vegetated scene...the best free items the internet can provide..LOL. 
### Creating skeleton code

With a fixed idea and a broad version of how the game might look, fill and operate, it was time to start the work. This game is built on a skeleton made up of various code lines. The aim was to have a clear version given me the chance to target a section on various intervals of coding days. After creating HTML and CSS, the JavaScript section of the game was structured as Background, Enemy, Handling, Player, Shield, Sound Controller, and UI. 
### Obtaining assets 

Apart from programing the skeleton and later cmpleting the code, gathering assets for the game was the second challenge that consumed most of the time during the project. Since sprites were needed to make the gam function, it was required to either serach and get sprites or create some. The flying madman is built on with the combination of sprites to create both characters and envionment. 
### Finish coding game

The final product for deployment is a flying madman shooter game. It was fun and tedious making everyhing to work and function how it should (or how I think it should). Nevertheless, I consider the "final product" to be fun to play and stress relieving - following the concept of "just break something useless, and feel good." During this process of the bootcamp, I think I built a product just for me - help take the stress of coding away.
