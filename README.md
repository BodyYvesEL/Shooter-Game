# Flying Madman Shooter Game
***
Creating the Flying Madman Shooter Game using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was a great way to learn Web Development while also creating an exciting and engaging game. This project has allowed me to develop my skills in HTML and CSS for layout styling, and JavaScript for game logic and interactivitity. Additionally, by creating this game, I have learned about game development process, user experience, and game design. After completing the process and programming, I have acquired a medium foundation in Web Development and I am able to continue building more complex and interactive applications.
